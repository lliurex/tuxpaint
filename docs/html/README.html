<h1><a name="about">About</a></h1>
<blockquote>

  <h2>What Is 'Tux&nbsp;Paint?'</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Tux Paint is a free drawing program designed for young children
    (kids ages 3 and up). It has a simple, easy-to-use interface, fun
    sound effects, and an encouraging cartoon mascot who helps guide
    children as they use the program.  It provides a blank canvas and
    a variety of drawing tools to help your child be creative.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2>License:</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Tux&nbsp;Paint is an Open&nbsp;Source project, Free&nbsp;Software
    released under the GNU General Public License (GPL).  It is free, and
    the 'source&nbsp;code' behind the program is available.  (This allows
    others to add features, fix bugs, and use parts of the program in their
    own GPL'd software.)</p>

    <p>See <a href="../COPYING.txt">COPYING.txt</a> for the full text of
    the GPL license.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2>Objectives:</h2>
  <blockquote>
  <dl>
    <dt><b>Easy and Fun</b></dt>
    <dd>
      Tux&nbsp;Paint is meant to be a simple drawing program for young children.
      It is not meant as a general-purpose drawing tool.  It <i>is</i> meant to
      be fun and easy to use.  Sound effects and a cartoon character help let
      the user know what's going on, and keeps them entertained.
      There are also extra-large cartoon-style mouse pointer shapes.
    </dd>

    <dt><b>Extensibility</b></dt>
    <dd>
      Tux&nbsp;Paint is extensible.  Brushes and "rubber stamp" shapes can be
      dropped in and pulled out.  For example, a teacher can drop in a
      collection of animal shapes and ask their students to draw an
      ecosystem.  Each shape can have a sound which is played, and
      textual facts which are displayed, when the child selects the shape.
    </dd>

    <dt><b>Portability</b></dt>
    <dd>
      Tux&nbsp;Paint is portable among various computer platforms:
      Windows, Macintosh, Linux, etc.  The interface looks the same among
      them all.  Tux&nbsp;Paint runs suitably well on older systems (like a
      Pentium&nbsp;133), and can be built to run better on slow systems.
    </dd>

    <dt><b>Simplicity</b></dt>
    <dd>
      There is no direct access to the computer's underlying intricacies.
      The current image is kept when the program quits, and reappears when
      it is restarted.  Saving images requires no need to create filenames
      or use the keyboard.  Opening an image is done by selecting it from
      a collection of thumbnails.  Access to other files on the computer is
      restricted.

<h1><a name="using">Using Tux&nbsp;Paint</a></h1>
<blockquote>

  <h2>Loading Tux&nbsp;Paint</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <h3>Linux/Unix Users</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Tux Paint should have placed a laucher icon in your KDE and/or GNOME
      menus, under 'Graphics.'</p>

      <p>Alternatively, you can run the following command at a shell prompt
      (e.g.,&nbsp;"$"):</p>

      <blockquote>
        <code>$ tuxpaint</code>
      </blockquote>

      <p>If any errors occur, they will be displayed on the terminal
      (to "stderr").</p>
    </blockquote>

    <hr size=1 noshade>

	Tux&nbsp;Paint
      </td></tr></table>
      
      <p>If you installed Tux&nbsp;Paint on your computer using the
      'Tux&nbsp;Paint&nbsp;Installer,' it will have asked you whether you
      wanted a 'Start' menu short-cut, and/or a desktop shortcut.  If you
      agreed, you can simply run Tux&nbsp;Paint from the 'Tux&nbsp;Paint'
      section of your 'Start' menu (e.g., under "All&nbsp;Programs" on
      Windows&nbsp;XP), or by double-clicking the "Tux&nbsp;Paint" icon
      on your desktop.</p>
     
      <p>If you installed Tux&nbsp;Paint using the 'ZIP-file' download,
      or if you used the 'Tux&nbsp;Paint&nbsp;Installer,' but chose not to
      have shortcuts installed, you'll need to double-click the
      "<code>tuxpaint.exe</code>" icon in the 'Tux&nbsp;Paint' folder on
      your computer.</p>

      <p>By default, the 'Tux&nbsp;Paint&nbsp;Installer' will put
      Tux&nbsp;Paint's folder in "<code>C:\Program&nbsp;Files\</code>",
      though you may have changed this when the installer ran.</p>

      <p>If you used the 'ZIP-file' download, Tux&nbsp;Paint's folder will
      be wherever you put it when you unzipped the ZIP file.</p>

  <hr size=1 noshade>


  <h2>Main Screen</h2>
  <blockquote>
    The main screen is divided into the following sections:

    <dl>
    <dt>Left Side: Toolbar</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>The toolbar contains the drawing and editing controls.</p>

      <!-- FIXME: Updated screenshot -->

      alt="[Tools: Paint, Stamp, Lines, Shapes, Text, Magic, Label, Undo, Redo,
      Eraser, New, Open, Save, Print, Quit]"></p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Middle: Drawing Canvas</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>The largest part of the screen, in the center, is the drawing
      canvas.  This is, obviously, where you draw!</p>

      <p align=center><img src="images/canvas.jpg" width=324 height=254
      alt="[(Canvas)]"></p>

      <p><b>Note:</b> The size of the drawing canvas depends on the size
      of Tux&nbsp;Paint. You can change the size of Tux&nbsp;Paint using
      the <i>Tux&nbsp;Paint&nbsp;Config.</i> configuration tool, or
      by other means. See the <a href="OPTIONS.html">OPTIONS</a> documentation
      for more details.</p>
    </dd>


    <dt>Right Side: Selector</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Depending on the current tool, the selector shows different
      things.  e.g., when the Paint&nbsp;Brush tool is selected, it shows
      the various brushes available.  When the Rubber&nbsp;Stamp tool
      is selected, it shows the different shapes you can use.</p>

      <p align=center><img src="images/selector.jpg" width=324 height=254
      alt="[Selectors - Brushes, Letters, Shapes, Stamps]"></p>

    <dt>Lower: Colors</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>A palette of available colors are shown near the bottom of the
      screen.</p>

      <p align=center><img src="images/colors.jpg" width=324 height=254
      alt="[Colors - Black, White, Red, Pink, Orange, Yellow, Green, Cyan,
      Blue, Purple, Brown, Grey]"></p>

      <p>At the very bottom of the screen, Tux, the Linux Penguin,
      provides tips and other information while you draw.</p>

      <p align=center><img src="images/tips.jpg" width=324 height=254
      alt="(For example: 'Pick a shape. Click to pick the center, drag, then

        <img src="images/tool_paint.png" width=48 height=48 alt="" align=right>

	<p>The Paint&nbsp;Brush tool lets you draw freehand, using various
        brushes (chosen in the Selector on the right) and colors
        (chosen in the Color palette towards the bottom).</p>

        <p>If you hold the mouse button down, and move the mouse, it will
        draw as you move.</p>

        <p>As you draw, a sound is played.  The bigger the brush, the
        lower the pitch.</p>

      <dd>
        <img src="images/tool_stamp.png" width=48 height=48 alt="" align=right>

        <p>The Stamp tool is like a set of rubber stamps or stickers.
	It lets you paste pre-drawn or photographic images (like a picture
	of a horse, or a tree, or the moon) in your picture.</p>

        <p>As you move the mouse around the canvas, an outline follows the
        mouse, showing where the stamp will be placed, and how big it will
	be.</p>

        <p align=center><img src="images/ex_stamps.png" width=182 height=156
        alt=""></p>

	<img src="images/tool_stamp_categories.png" width=96 height=48 alt=""
	align=right>
	<p>There can be numerous categories of stamps (e.g., animals,
	plants, outer space, vehicles, people, etc.).  Use the
	Left and Right arrows to cycle through the collections.</p>

	<p>Some stamps can be colored or tinted.  If the color palette
        below the canvas is activated, you can click the colors to change
	the tint or color of the stamp before placing it in the picture.</p>
	
	<p>Stamps can be shrunk and expanded, and many stamps can be
	flipped vertically, or displayed as a mirror-image, using
	controls at the bottom right of the screen.</p>

	<p align=center>
	<img src="images/tool_stamp_controls.png" width=96 height=96 alt="">
	</p>

	<img src="images/tool_sfx.png" width=48 height=24 alt="" align=right>
        <p>Different stamps can have different sound effects and/or
	descriptive (spoken) sounds.  Buttons at the lower left
	(near Tux, the Linux penguin) allow you to re-play the sound effects
	and descriptive sounds for the currently-selected stamp.</p>

	<p>(NOTE: If the "<code>nostampcontrols</code>" option is set,
	Tux&nbsp;Paint won't display the Mirror, Flip, Shrink and Grow
	controls for stamps.
	See the "<a href="OPTIONS.html"><i>Options</i></a>"
	documentation.)</p>

      <dd>
        <img src="images/tool_lines.png" width=48 height=48 alt="" align=right>

        <p>This tool lets you draw straight lines using the various
        brushes and colors you normally use with the Paint Brush.</p>

        <p>Click the mouse and hold it to choose the starting point of the
        line.  As you move the mouse around, a thin 'rubber-band' line
        will show where the line will be drawn.</p>

        <p>Let go of the mouse to complete the line.  A "sproing!" sound will
        play.</p>

        align=right>

        <p>This tool lets you draw some simple filled, and un-filled shapes.</p>

	<p>Select a shape from the selector on the right (circle, square,
	oval, etc.).</p>

	<p>In the canvas, click the mouse and hold it to stretch the shape
	out from where you clicked.  Some shapes can change proportion
	(e.g., rectangle and oval), others cannot (e.g., square and circle).</p>

	<p>Let go of the mouse when you're done stretching.</p>

        <dl>
	  <dt>Normal Mode</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>Now you can move the mouse around the canvas to rotate the

	    current color.</p>
	  </dd>

          <dt>Simple Shapes Mode</dt>
	  <dd>
            If simple shapes are enabled (e.g., with the
            "<code>--simpleshapes</code>" option),
            the shape will be drawn on the canvas when you let go of the
            mouse button.  (There's no rotation step.)

        <img src="images/tool_text.png" width=48 height=48 alt="" align=right>

        <p>Choose a font (from the 'Letters' available on the right) and a color
	(from the color palette near the bottom).  Click on the screen and a
	cursor will appear.  Type text and it will show up on the screen.</p>
	
	<p>Press <b>[Enter]</b> or <b>[Return]</b> and the text will be drawn
        onto the picture and the cursor will move down one line.</p>

        <p>Alternatively, press <b>[Tab]</b> and the text will be drawn onto
        the picture, but the cursor will move to the right of the text,
        rather than down a line, and to the left.  (This can be useful to
        create a line of text with mixed colors, fonts, styles and sizes:
        <code>Like</code> <font color="#880000"><i><b>this</b></i></font>.)</p>
	
	<p>Clicking elsewhere in the picture while the text entry is still
        active causes the current line of text to move to that location
        (where you can continue editing it).</p>

        <dl>
        <dt><b>Text versus Label</b></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>The <b>Text</b> tool is the original text-entry tool in
          Tux&nbsp;Paint.  Text entered using this tool can't be modified
          or moved later, since it becomes part of the drawing.  However,
          because the text becomes part of the picture, it can be drawn
          over or modified using <b>Magic</b> tool effects (e.g., smudged,
          tinted, embossed, etc.)</p>

          <p>When using the <b>Label</b> tool (which was added to
          Tux&nbsp;Paint in version 0.9.22), the text 'floats' over the
          image, and the details of the label (the text, the position of
          the label, the font choice and the color) get stored separately.
          This allows the label to be repositioned or edited later.</p>

          <p>The <b>Label</b> tool can be disabled (e.g., by selecting
          "Disable&nbsp;'Label'&nbsp;Tool" in <i>Tux&nbsp;Paint&nbsp;Config.</i>
          or running <i>Tux&nbsp;Paint</i> with the "<code>--nolabel</code>"
          command-line option).</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><b>International Character Input</b></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Tux Paint allows inputting characters in different languages.
          Most Latin characters (<i>A</i>-<i>Z</i>,
          <i>&ntilde;</i>, <i>&egrave;</i>, etc.) can by entered directly.
          Some languages require that Tux&nbsp;Paint be switched into an
          alternate input mode before entering, and some characters must be
          composed using numerous keypresses.</p>

          <p>When Tux Paint's locale is set to one of the
          languages that provide alternate input modes, a key is used to
          cycle through normal (Latin character) and locale-specific
          mode or modes.</p>

          <p>Currently supported locales, the input methods available, and
          the key to toggle or cycle modes, are listed below.
          <b>Note:</b> Many fonts do not include all characters for
          all languages, so sometimes you'll need to change fonts to see the
          characters you're trying to type.

        <p>The 'Magic' tool is actually a set of special tools.  Select one of
	the "magic" effects from the selector on the right.  Then, depending
        on the tool, you can either click and drag around the picture,
        and/or simply click the picture once, to apply the effect.</p>

        <p>If the tool can be used by clicking and dragging, a 'painting'
        button will be available on the left, below the list of "magic" tools
        on the right side of the screen.  If the tool can affect the entire

        (or click and drag), the picture will be erased.  (This may be
        white, some other color, or to a background picture, depending on
        the picture.)</p>

	<p>A number of eraser sizes are available, both round and square..</p>

        <p>As you move the mouse around, a square outline follows
        the pointer, showing what part of the picture will be erased to

        <p>As you erase, a "squeaky clean" eraser/wiping sound is played.</p>

	  <p>When you load a 'Starter,' draw on it, and then click 'Save,'
          it creates a new picture file (it doesn't overwrite the original

          <blockquote><code>
	    lpr
	  </code></blockquote>

	  <p>This command can be changed by setting the "printcommand" value

	  <p>If the <b>[Alt]</b> key on the keyboard is being pushed

          <blockquote><code>
	    kprinter

	  <p>This command can be changed by setting the "altprintcommand" value
	  in Tux&nbsp;Paint's configuration file.</p>

	  pushed.</p>

	  <p>However, if you hold the <b>[Alt]</b> (or <b>[Option]</b>) key
          on the keyboard while pushing the button, as long as you're

	  "<code>--printcfg</code>" on the command-line, or
	  "<code>printcfg=yes</code>" in Tux&nbsp;Paint's own configuration
	  file ("<code>tuxpaint.cfg</code>").</p>

	  <p>If the "printcfg" option is used, printer settings will

<h1><a name="loading_into">Loading Other Pictures into Tux&nbsp;Paint</a></h1>
<blockquote>
  <p>Since Tux&nbsp;Paint's 'Open' dialog only displays pictures you created
  with Tux&nbsp;Paint, what if you want to load some other picture or
  photograph into Tux&nbsp;Paint to edit?</p>

  <p>To do so, you simply need to convert the picture into
  a PNG (Portable Network Graphic) image file, and place it in Tux&nbsp;Paint's
  "saved" directory:</p>
  
  <dl>
  <dt>Windows Vista</dt>
  <dd>Inside the user's "<code>AppData</code>" folder,
    e.g.: <code>"C:\Users\<i>(user&nbsp;name)</i>\AppData\Roaming\TuxPaint\saved\</code>"</dd>

  <dt>Windows 95, 98, ME, 2000, XP</dt>
  <dd>Inside the user's "<code>Application&nbsp;Data</code>" folder,
    e.g.: <code>"C:\Documents and Settings\<i>(user&nbsp;name)</i>\Application
    Data\TuxPaint\saved\</code>"</dd>
  
  <dt>Mac OS X</dt>
  <dd>Inside the user's "<code>Library</code>" folder:
    <code>"/Users/<i>(user&nbsp;name)</i>/Library/Application Support/Tux&nbsp;Paint/saved/</code>"</dd>
  
  <dt>Linux/Unix</dt>
  <dd>Inside a hidden "<code>.tuxpaint</code>" directory, in the user's
    home directory: "<code>$(HOME)/.tuxpaint/saved/</code>"</dd>
  </dl>

  <p><b>Note:</b> It is from this folder that you can copy or open pictures
  drawn in Tux&nbsp;Paint using other applications.</p>

  <h2>Using '<code>tuxpaint-import</code>'</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Linux and Unix users can use the "<code><b>tuxpaint-import</b></code>"
    shell script which gets installed when you install Tux&nbsp;Paint.
    It uses some NetPBM tools to convert the image ("<code>anytopnm</code>"),
    resize it so that it will fit in Tux&nbsp;Paint's canvas
    ("<code>pnmscale</code>"), and convert it to a PNG
    ("<code>pnmtopng</code>").</p>

    <p>It also uses the "<code>date</code>" command to get the current time and
    date, which is the file-naming convention Tux&nbsp;Paint uses for saved
    files.  (Remember, you are never asked for a 'filename' when you go to
    Save or Open pictures!)</p>

    <p>To use '<code>tuxpaint-import</code>', simply run the command from a
    command-line prompt and provide it the name(s) of the file(s) you wish
    to convert.</p>

    <p>They will be converted and placed in your Tux&nbsp;Paint 'saved'
    directory. (Note: If you're doing this for a different user - e.g.,
    your child, you'll need to make sure to run the command under their
    account.)</p>

    <p>Example:</p>

    <blockquote><code>
      $ <b>tuxpaint-import grandma.jpg</b><br>
      grandma.jpg -&gt; /home/username/.tuxpaint/saved/20020921123456.png<br>
      jpegtopnm: WRITING A PPM FILE
    </code></blockquote>

    <p>The first line ("<code>tuxpaint-import&nbsp;grandma.jpg</code>") is the
    command to run. The following two lines are output from the program while
    it's working.</p>
    
    <p>Now you can load Tux&nbsp;Paint, and a version of that original picture
    will be available under the 'Open' dialog.  Just double-click its icon!</p>
  </blockquote>


  <h2>Doing it Manually</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Windows, Mac OS X and BeOS users must currently do the conversion
    manually.</p>

    <p>Load a graphics program that is capable of both loading your picture
    and saving a PNG format file.  (See the documentation file
    "<a href="../PNG.txt">PNG.txt</a>" for a list of suggested software,
    and other references.)</p>

    <p>When Tux Paint loads an image that's not the same size as its drawing
    canvas, it scales (and sometimes smears the edges of) the image so that
    it fits within the canvas.</p>

    <p>To avoid having the image stretched or smeared, you can resize it
    to Tux&nbsp;Paint's canvas size.  This size depends on the size of
    the Tux&nbsp;Paint window, or resolution at which Tux&nbsp;Paint is
    run, if in fullscreen.  (<b>Note:</b> The default resolution is 800x600.)
    See "Calculating Image Dimensions", below.</p>

    <p>Save the picture in PNG format.  It is <b>highly</b> recommended that you
    name the filename using the current date and time, since that's
    the convention Tux&nbsp;Paint uses:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <code><b>YYYYMMDDhhmmss</b>.png</code>
    </blockquote>

    <ul>
    <li>YYYY = Year
    <li>MM = Month (01-12)
    <li>DD = Day (01-31)
    <li>HH = Hour, in 24-hour format (00-23)
    <li>mm = Minute (00-59)
    <li>ss = Second (00-59)
    </ul>

    <p>e.g.:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>20020921130500</code> - for September 21, 2002, 1:05:00pm
    </blockquote>

    <p>Place this PNG file in your Tux&nbsp;Paint '<code>saved</code>'
    directory.  (See above.)</p>
    
    <h3>Calculating Image Dimensions</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The width of Tux&nbsp;Paint's canvas is simply the width of the
      window (e.g., 640, 800 or 1024 pixels), minus 192.</p>

      <p>Calculating the height of Tux&nbsp;Paint's canvas requires multiple
      steps:
      <ol>
      <li>Take the height of the window (e.g, 480, 600 or 768 pixels) and
        subtract 144
      <li>Take the result of Step&nbsp;1 and divide it by 48
      <li>Take the result of Step&nbsp;2 and round it down (e.g., 9.5 becomes
        simply 9)
      <li>Take the result of Step&nbsp;3 and multiply it by 48
      <li>Finally, take the result of Step&nbsp;4 and add 40
      </ol></p>

      <p><b>Example:</b> Tux&nbsp;Paint running at fullscreen on a 1440x900
      display.
      <ul>
      <li>The canvas width is simply 1440&nbsp;-&nbsp;192, or 1248.
      <li>The canvas height is calculated as:
        <ol>
        <li>900&nbsp;-&nbsp;144, or 756
        <li>756&nbsp;/&nbsp;48, or 15.75
        <li>15.75 rounded down, or 15
        <li>15&nbsp;*&nbsp;48, or 720
        <li>720&nbsp;+&nbsp;40, or 760
        </ol>
      </ul>
      So the canvas within a 1440x900 Tux&nbsp;Paint window is 1248x760.</p>
