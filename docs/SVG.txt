SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is an open standard used to describe
two-dimensional vector graphics.  It is great for diagrams and shapes,
while PNGs are better for photographs.  SVG files are a bit like instructions
on how to make an image.  This means that they can be resized without looking
pixelated or blocky.

Wikipedia, an online user-driven encyclopedia, has lots more info:

SVGs On the Web
---------------
  Web browsers like Mozilla Firefox, Apple's Safari and Opera have some
  SVG support.  A plugin is available to see SVG images in older versions of
  Microsoft Internet Explorer ( http://www.adobe.com/svg/viewer/install/ ).

How to make SVGs
----------------
  Linux/Unix users
  ----------------
    A popular Open Source program used to make SVGs is Inkscape
    ( http://www.inkscape.org/ ). This will most likely be packaged for
    your distribution / operating system.

    An earlier program (which Inkscape is based on) is Sodipodi
    ( http://www.sodipodi.com/ ).

    Libraries which support SVG include Cairo ( http://cairographics.org/ )
    and Batik ( http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/ ).

  Mac and Windows users
  ---------------------
    Inkscape is available for Mac OSX and Windows.  (See above.)

    Commercial software like Adobe Illustrator, CorelDRAW and Microsoft Visio
    have SVG support.
