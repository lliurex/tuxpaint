                         Tux Paint "Magic" Tool: Flower

                  By Bill Kendrick <bill@newbreedsoftware.com>

   This tool draws small flowers, with leafy bases and stalks. Click to set
   the base, then drag the mouse upwards to drawe the stalk, and finally
   release the mouse button to finish the flower. It will be drawn in the
   currently-selected color. The shape and length of the stalk depends on how
   you move the mouse while you drag.
